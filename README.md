# hello-world
This is my test repo created while following along with the tutorial on github.com. 

We're going to be editing help.xml files directly in GitHub! 

## Fun with merge conflicts
I accidentally created a merge conflict already, because I made one change to this file in the master brand and another change to the same file in my "readme-edits" branch. Now I am going to add another change to see whether I can make the file conflict worse. Or maybe fix it.
